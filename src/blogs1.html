   		<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
   		<p align="left">We all start with either a dataset or a goal in mind. Once weâ€™ve found, collected or scraped our data, we pull it up, and witness the overwhelming sight of merciless cells of numbers, more numbers, categories, and maybe some words ðŸ˜¨! A naive thought crosses our mind, to use our machine learning prowess to deal with this tangled messâ€¦ but a quick search reveals the host of tasks weâ€™ll need to consider before training a model ðŸ˜±!
        Once we overcome the shock of our unruly data we look for ways to battle our formidable nemesis ðŸ¤”. We start with trying to get our data into Python. It is relatively simple on paper, but the process can be slightlyâ€¦ involved. Nonetheless, a little effort was all that was needed (lucky us).</p>

        <p align="left">Without wasting any time we begin data cleaning to get rid of the bogus and expose the beautiful. Our methods start simple â€” observe and remove. It works a few times, but then we realiseâ€¦ it really doesnâ€™t do us justice! To deal with the mess though, we find a powerful tool to add to our arsenal: charts! With our graphs, we can get a feel for our data, the patterns within it and where things are missing. We can interpolating (fill in) or removing missing data.</p>
